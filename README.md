# OOP-2017_CA
This program is used to let users know about our universe that we lived in.
First, when this program running, it will show the solar system to users.
And if users want to know where is the planet and what name is it, just need to hold the mouse left button
and  the name of the planet will display.

I used a for loop to display some shining stars and a class to display the buttons.
I created many boolean variables to display different information of different planets.
I really like those shining stars wrote by code.
